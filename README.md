# getEvents
The getEvents script fetches calendar event data from a specified ICS (iCalendar) URL and displays events for the current date.
This script can be used as a user command function in the obsidian community plugin [Templater]([https://github.com/vuejs/vue](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/)). 
To use this script you need to enter your ics url in the second line.
