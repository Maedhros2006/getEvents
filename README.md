# getEvents
The getEvents script fetches calendar event data from a specified ICS (iCalendar) URL and displays events for the current date.
This script can be used as a user command function in the obsidian community plugin [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/). 
To use this script you need to enter your ICS URL in the second line.
If you want to get results in something other than +2 UTC you will have to modify the timeshift variable.
